# SQL Project: Data Analysis on a Food Delivery Application

## 📌 Overview

This project showcases my ability to work with relational databases using SQL. I’ve built and analyzed a fictional food delivery platform called **Dishcover**, where I used PostgreSQL to create schemas, clean data, and solve business problems through real-world SQL queries.

**Dishcover** is a combination of *"Dish"* and *"Discover"*, reflecting the goal of exploring food ordering patterns and business performance insights in the restaurant delivery ecosystem.

In addition to SQL analysis, I’ve also created a **Power BI dashboard** to visualize key insights from the dataset — making trends, patterns, and outliers easier to interpret and present.

## 🗂️ Project Highlights

* ✅ Created and managed a PostgreSQL database (`dishcover_db`)
* ✅ Designed normalized tables for customers, restaurants, orders, deliveries, and riders
* ✅ Imported structured CSV data into each table
* ✅ Cleaned and handled null/missing data
* ✅ Solved **20 real-world business problems** using SQL (e.g., customer churn, top dishes, city rankings)
* ✅ Built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to visualize key business insights

## 📚 What I Learned from This Project
Through Dishcover, I didn’t just write SQL queries—I learned how to think like a data analyst. Here's what I practiced:

📌 Database Design – Created clean and structured tables using real-world relationships
🔍 Data Filtering & Retrieval – Wrote queries to get the right answers from large datasets
📊 Aggregation & Grouping – Used functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG to find key insights
🔗 Joins – Connected multiple tables (e.g., orders, customers, restaurants) to get complete answers
🪟 Window Functions – Used RANK, ROW_NUMBER,LAG etc., for advanced analysis
🕒 Date & Time Functions – Found trends over months, years, time slots
🔁 Conditional Logic – Applied CASE WHEN to add logic inside SQL queries
🧠 Subqueries – Wrote queries inside queries for more complex problems

This project also helped me visualize insights using Power BI, making the data easier to understand for non-technical people.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard – Dishcover

To make the insights more interactive and visually compelling, I designed a **Power BI dashboard** for the **Dishcover** project using real-world food delivery data. This dashboard provides a clear overview of key business metrics through intuitive visuals:

### 🔍 Key Highlights:

- 💰 **Total Sales**: ₹987M across 150K orders  
- 🍛 **Category Breakdown**:
  - **Veg**: ₹122M | ⭐ 122M ratings  
  - **Non-Veg**: ₹106M | ⭐ 106M ratings  
  - **Other**: ₹24M | ⭐ 24M ratings  
- 🏙️ **Top 50 Cities by Order Amount**  
  *(e.g., Tirupati, Pune, Delhi, Raipur, Bikaner)*
- 📈 **Year-wise Sales Trend**:
  - Peak in 2018 (₹0.41bn)
  - Decline observed in 2020 (₹0.14bn)
- 📦 **Quantity Ordered**: 2M units  
- ⭐ **Total Ratings**: 148K  

Users can toggle between **Amount** and **Quantity** views. Filters like **Top 5/10/20/50/100 cities** enhance interactivity.

## 🧱 Database Structure

The database includes the following tables:

* `restaurants`: Info about restaurants
* `customers`: User details and registration dates
* `orders`: Orders placed by customers
* `deliveries`: Delivery details of each order
* `riders`: Rider details and signup info

## 🚀 How to Use This Project

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Open **pgAdmin 4**.
3. Run `Dishcover_Schema.sql` to set up all tables.
4. Import CSV data into each table in this order:

   * customers → restaurants → orders → riders → deliveries
5. Run queries from `20 Business Problems solution.sql` to explore insights.
6. Open the Power BI file to explore visualized insights.

## ✅ Conclusion

This project helped me put my SQL knowledge into practice by building a database from scratch and solving real-world business problems in the context of a food delivery company. I learned how to set up and manage tables, clean and import data, and write queries to answer business questions like identifying top customers, most popular dishes, or tracking delivery performance.

With the addition of **Power BI**, I translated raw SQL insights into visual stories — making the data easier to interpret for non-technical users. This project has strengthened both my data analysis skills and my ability to think like a data-driven decision-maker.
