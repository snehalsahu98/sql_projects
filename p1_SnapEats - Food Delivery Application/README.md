# SnapEats: SQL Data Analysis on a Food Delivery Application

## 📌 Overview

This project showcases my ability to work with relational databases using SQL. I’ve built and analyzed a fictional food delivery platform called **SnapEats**, where I used PostgreSQL to create schemas, clean data, and solve business problems through real-world SQL queries.

The name **SnapEats** reflects the idea of getting food “in a snap” — highlighting speed, convenience, and seamless food ordering in the restaurant delivery ecosystem.

## 🗂️ Project Highlights

* ✅ Created and managed a PostgreSQL database 
* ✅ Designed normalized tables for customers, restaurants, orders, deliveries, and riders
* ✅ Imported structured CSV data into each table
* ✅ Cleaned and handled null/missing data
* ✅ Solved **20+ real-world business problems** using SQL (e.g., customer churn, top dishes, city rankings)

## 📚 What I Learned from This Project
Through SnapEats, I didn’t just write SQL queries—I learned how to think like a data analyst. Here's what I practiced:

- 📌 Database Design – Created clean and structured tables using real-world relationships
- 🔍 Data Filtering & Retrieval – Wrote queries to get the right answers from large datasets
- 📊 Aggregation & Grouping – Used functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG to find key insights
- 🔗 Joins – Connected multiple tables (e.g., orders, customers, restaurants) to get complete answers
- 🪟 Window Functions – Used RANK, ROW_NUMBER,LAG etc., for advanced analysis
- 🕒 Date & Time Functions – Found trends over months, years, time slots
- 🔁 Conditional Logic – Applied CASE WHEN to add logic inside SQL queries
- 🧠 Subqueries – Wrote queries inside queries for more complex problems

## ✅ Conclusion

This project helped me put my SQL knowledge into practice by building a database from scratch and solving real-world business problems in the context of a food delivery company. I learned how to set up and manage tables, clean and import data, and write queries to answer business questions like identifying top customers, most popular dishes, or tracking delivery performance.
